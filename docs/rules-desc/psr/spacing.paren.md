This rule enures:
- Single space after control structure keywords (if, for, foreach, while, do, switch, catch)
- No space before the opening parenthesis of functions, methods, closures, calls and arrays
- No space after the opening parenthesis
- No space before the closing parenthesis
- A single space after the closing parenthesis (except when followed by a semicolon)
